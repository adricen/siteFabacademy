### Machin Design


---

###  Design thinking :
#### <a name="process"></a> Process
##### <a name="inspi"></a>**Inspiration :**

To begin with this machin we choose to take two machin as reference. The first one is the one from Hector and the second one came from Nadya. ![put pictures]()  

##### <a name="design"></a> **Designing :**
The main goal we wanted to succed in making this machin so that anybody who have access to a milling machin could do this.

##### <a name="stock"></a>**Think about the stock and your machin :**
There is two main constrain that you couldn't avoid when doing a machin like that it's your stack, what size and weight is it.

##### <a name="proto"></a>milling prototyping
In order to know more about rack and minion, I made a first rack and minino with a junk of wood we had here in the lab.

Then I wanted to be sure of the joinery I made, so I made a simple milling test on our shopbot.

##### <a name="proto"></a>3D prototyping
To be sure about the join I used I made some rapid prototyping with the milling machin first, and then with the 3D printer.

##### <a name="parametric"></a>Parametric design
I know that I would have to make a lot of back and forth to succed to make this machin so I worked on making the joinery parametricaly depending on my stock height and my the smaller mill I have that could go that deep.

##### <a name="montage"></a>Montage
  ( animated montage + video )

###  Milling :
#### <a name="prepa"></a>Preparation
##### <a name="stockCrea"></a>Create stock from reality

Start by making a virtual reproducion of your stock. The Pom / Delerain we have make 500mmx501mm
