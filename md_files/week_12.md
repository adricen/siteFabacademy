For this assignement I choose to work on the speaker board, because I am probably going to need something like that.

| I begin to be used to fuse board. So, as usual, to make the file, I used the command line `make -f hello.speaker.45.make` and then `make -f hello.speaker.45.make program-usbtiny` | ![helloSpeak](assets\img\week12\speakerProgram.png) |

and ther it is, it seams to work fine. I managed to make it run his program. The next step is to add this speaker to the `step reponce` board.
