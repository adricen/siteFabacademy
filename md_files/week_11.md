## Assignement

## result

It's time to work fully on my final project, so I choose two input device for now, the first one is the inductance table and the seconde one is the distance detector. The objective is to make a fully fonctionnal beatbox machin at the end using buttons and distance sonar to detect if someone is here.

### The sonar distance

For now I just took the initial board and craft them directly to see how they work.

Fuse is ok, I have the program that is fully loaded. I still have difficulties to load and conect to my interface.
