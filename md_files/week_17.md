# Fabacademy : *Week 17*

## Assignement - Wildcard - [schedule](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/wildcard/index.html)

Design and produce something with a digital fabrication process
   (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered
   in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your
   assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce
   it. Possibilities include (but are not limited to) composites, textiles,
   biotechnology, robotics, and cooking.

## work it out

As a wildcard and after tchatting with my local instructor, I choose to mill a PCB with the shopbot CNC we have here. Since I engraved all my PCB with laser from the beginning, I didn't have the occasion to try it myself. So I through myself in it.
