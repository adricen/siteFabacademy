# Fabacademy : *Week 17*

## Assignement - Wildcard - [schedule](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/wildcard/index.html)

Design and produce something with a digital fabrication process
   (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered
   in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your
   assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce
   it. Possibilities include (but are not limited to) composites, textiles,
   biotechnology, robotics, and cooking.

## Exploring soft robotics

In the previous Fabricademy, [Julie Taris](http://wiki.textile-academy.org/fabricademy2017/students/julie.taris/start) from Fablab digiscope, explored a way of making soft material with laser cutter and special ThermoVinyl. the result give an inflate material capabloe of taking fifferent shapes.

### Engraving and result

## Starting milling PCB

As a wildcard and after tchatting with my local instructor, I choose to mill a PCB with the shopbot CNC we have here. Since I engraved all my PCB with laser from the beginning, I didn't have the occasion to try it myself. So I through myself in it.
