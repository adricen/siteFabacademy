The goal is to make a prototype of my final project, wich is there : [Final Project Developpement](assignement.html?page=finalProject)

Let's work on the entire production chain and explore some soft I don't know. As a 3D artist, I am already used to Maya, 3Dsmax, Zbrush, Photoshop

## Work...

### Uses Cases :

* Using 3D mouse into a 3D world for object manipulation
* Working with "wilder" screen and being able to interact with huge virtual space.
* Moving his hand in virtual world for desable people with hand cut.
* Work inside 3D software


### Draw and Scan :

### Gimp 2 :

Last Time I opened Gimp, it was like time traveling. The interface was look like the one of photoshop 6... Since the ux design and interface standart hagve moved on to a greater level and became central to app developpement.

So first impression is pretty cool regarding the progress they've done so far.
