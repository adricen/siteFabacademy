### Xnview by Softtonic :


I would have add this little soft to the already big list in the shcedule of this week.
It have some pretty cool features that allow you to manipulate and make small modification/convertion really quickly.

Link to the soft : [download here](https://www.xnview.com/)

Basicaly I am using some small features wich are presente in this soft. Initialy I was using it when I was working in video games, because this soft allow you to see and edit the mipmap of your image (for .dds file format ).

> you can pass from one pic to another using `Page up` or `Page down`

Let see how it work :

| definition | pics |
| --- | --- |
| This is the control panel. As you can do it in Adobe bridge, you can browse your file and see the preview of your picture. Double clic on your selected pics to edit it. | ![xnview01](assets\img\week3\xnView01.jpg) |
| There you have some interessente features. You can configure your favorite editing soft on some simple shortcut. | ![xnview02](assets\img\week3\xnView02.png) |


**Associate programmes :**

| **Erase metadata** Sometimes you can gain some space on your picture size removing metadata such as author, date... | ![Xnview06](assets\img\week3\xnView06.jpg) |

> Those settting possibility offert you a good tool to make quick modification on your pics without entering into a big file editor manager.

### Gimp 2 :

Last Time I opened Gimp, it was like time traveling. The interface was look like the one of photoshop 6... Since the ux design and interface standart hagve moved on to a greater level and became central to app developpement.

So first impression is pretty cool regarding the progress they've done so far.

### Fusion 360 - free autodesk software for teacher and student

Fusion 360 have the adventage to be free for uses and seams to offert really good modelisation and design features.

Once my soft was installed, I started to play around with it.

### Solidworks

#### From Dust to Rust

I installed my version of Solidwork, unpacking it with my personnal key that I fresshly recive, thank's to the Fabacademy. First Time I open this soft, First look at it, I can say that it doesn't look like any interface I know.

![interface](assets\img\week3\solid00.jpg)

Let's face it... I am not gonna became a fabulous user of this soft just at look at the interface and test radom button, there is too many of them and too many menus. So Let's try the "for beginners" tutoriel.
