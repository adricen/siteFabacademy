# Fabacademy : *Week 3* - **January 31/2018**


## Assignement - computer-aided design - [Schedule](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html)

> * Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project
post it on your class page

The goal is to make a prototype of my final project, wich is there : [Final Project Developpement](assignement.html?page=finalProject)

Let's work on the entire production chain and explore some soft I don't know. As a 3D artist, I am already used to Maya, 3Dsmax, Zbrush, Photoshop

## Work...

[xnview](#xnview-by-softtonic-) / [Gimp 2.0](#gimp-2-) / [Fusion360](#fusion-360-free-autodesk-software-for-teacher-and-student) / [Solidworks](#solidworks) / [Antimony](#antimony) / [Antimony with Maya](#antimony-with-maya-and-other-soft) / [Rhino et Grasshoper](rinho-3d-and-grasshoper)

### Xnview by Softtonic :


I would have add this little soft to the already big list in the shcedule of this week.
It have some pretty cool features that allow you to manipulate and make small modification/convertion really quickly.

Link to the soft : [download here](https://www.xnview.com/)

Basicaly I am using some small features wich are presente in this soft. Initialy I was using it when I was working in video games, because this soft allow you to see and edit the mipmap of your image (for .dds file format ).

> you can pass from one pic to another using `Page up` or `Page down`

Let see how it work :

| definition | pics |
| --- | --- |
| This is the control panel. As you can do it in Adobe bridge, you can browse your file and see the preview of your picture. Double clic on your selected pics to edit it. | ![xnview01](assets\img\week3\xnView01.jpg) |
| There you have some interessente features. You can configure your favorite editing soft on some simple shortcut. | ![xnview02](assets\img\week3\xnView02.png) |


**Associate programmes :**

![Xnview03](assets\img\week3\xnView03.png)

Cliquing on associate programme, you can associate your favorit tool like Alt+1
This way, once you have the image you want to work on, just clic on the defined shortcut to openit within your soft.

**Cleaning image :**

| def | pic |
| --- | --- |
| **Erase Alpha layer** | ![Xnview07](assets\img\week3\xnView07.jpg) |
| **Erase metadata** Sometimes you can gain some space on your picture size removing metadata such as author, date... | ![Xnview06](assets\img\week3\xnView06.jpg) |

> Those settting possibility offert you a good tool to make quick modification on your pics without entering into a big file editor manager.

### Gimp 2 :

Last Time I opened Gimp, it was like time traveling. The interface was look like the one of photoshop 6... Since the ux design and interface standart hagve moved on to a greater level and became central to app developpement.

So first impression is pretty cool regarding the progress they've done so far.

### Fusion 360 - free autodesk software for teacher and student

Fusion 360 have the adventage to be free for uses and seams to offert really good modelisation and design features.

#### Let's Jump!

Once my soft was installed, I started to play around with it.

| def | pics |
| --- | --- |
| Trying some simple shapes | ![fusion](assets\img\week3\Fusion360-00.png) |
| I have done the [Sketch tutorial](http://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?utm_medium=product&utm_source=fusion360&utm_campaign=help-and-training&utm_id=662996&mktvar002=662996&fgvid=04ab374d-684f-48c0-be4a-091b2c8a681d#sketch), and I think I wil go further on this course later | ![fusion](assets\img\week3\Fusion360-02.png) |

### Solidworks

#### From Dust to Rust

I installed my version of Solidwork, unpacking it with my personnal key that I fresshly recive, thank's to the Fabacademy. First Time I open this soft, First look at it, I can say that it doesn't look like any interface I know.

![interface](assets\img\week3\solid00.jpg)

Let's face it... I am not gonna became a fabulous user of this soft just at look at the interface and test radom button, there is too many of them and too many menus. So Let's try the "for beginners" tutoriel.

### Antimony

I finally found a way to install Antimony on windows 10. Let's jump and detail the process a little bit. From now you are from 4 step to run it and have fun. but first...

#### a. Install the Ubuntu environment on you windows 10 --> [source here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)

![outside_pics_01](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ximg_570997a37ca4e.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.sRQi9uZ3CQ.png)

| <center><i class="fa fa-500px"></i></center> | <center><i class="fa fa-book"></i></center> |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Activate Windows developper mode** | ![outside_pics_02](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ximg_570999e304309.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.5V9iFGJlWR.png) |
| **2. Open Control Panel > Programs and activate `windows Subsystem for linux(Beta)`** |![ubuntu00](assets\img\week2\ubuntuBash00.jpg) |
| **3. Open Bash** | ![outside_pics_02](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ximg_57099904643e7.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.0LbC1f1nur.png) |
| **4. Update to Ubuntu Bash** | ![ubuntu02](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ximg_570998bb8323b.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.l29bWUELIg.png) |
| **5. Run Install** | `lxrun /install /y` |
| **6. Open Ubuntu Bash and tap `sudo apt-get upgrade`** | ![ubuntu03](assets\img\week2\ubuntuBash02.jpg) |


> Be Carefull ! This console seams to work fine so far but have a little defect. `You can't see your USB output`, `ls usb won't work` because for now they are not integrate t this environment so you won't be able to programme your favorites Atmel chips... So sad. Windows user were so cloth to have a fully ubuntu core environment !


#### b. Configure your root account and connect to it --> [source here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/772050/reset-the-password-in-linux-bash-in-windows)

You have two methods, wether you connect directly to your root account with your administrator user account like this :

```unix

sudo su

```

or you configure your root user account password that will allow to switch to your root account just tapping `su`. That's what I did and it work fine for me.

* a. Run bashand make a note of your Linux username (this need not match your Windows username), see How can I find out my user name?
* b. In Windows admin command prompt (Super+X, A) change the default user to root:
```
ubuntu config --default-user root
```

* c. Now Bash on Ubuntu on Windows logs you in as root without asking password
* d. Use passwd command in Bash to change the user password (the user whose password you want to reset):
```
passwd your_username
```

* e. Change the default user back to your normal user in Windows command prompt
```
ubuntu config --default-user  your_username
```

Once it's done, you should be able to connect to your `root` account, so do it!


#### c. install an Xming server --> [install here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/)

You will need a display emulator to run the display of your application. Xming work fine so far so just install it and run it, default parametres are fine.

#### d. The last part ! Install Antimony --> [instructions](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/blob/master/BUILDING.md#linux)

You can now run the install procedure describe on the antimony github page, just be sure to be connected as `root` user and to do an 'apt-get update' just after you get dependencies. So your command lines would be :

```
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install git build-essential libpng-dev python3-dev libboost-all-dev  libgl1-mesa-dev lemon flex qt5-default ninja-build cmake

# update dependencies
apt-get update

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony
cd antimony

# Make a build folder
mkdir build
cd build

# Build and launch the application
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
./app/antimony
```
And that's it, you can now run antimony directly into windows, without having to switch to a double linux boot...

### Antimony with maya

This is more one of a futur things I will try to do. I am a maya user for almost 15 years now, and the core of this soft is made with Python. It should be possible to make an integration of the shapes generated by antimony inside maya at minima, the must would be a full integration of it but let's be pragmatic and go step by step...

### Rinho 3d and Grasshoper
