## Practice

### I. Work through a git tutorial

#### a. My personnal history with git

I discovered git three years ago when I started to learn about web developpement.
At that time, I have been engaged in a quite big association in order to teech web developpement and coach young adulte living in popular area. I started to work on git hub with them, beginning by the online-interface of github, guid them through the creation of somme simple md files to learn about html structure. Then created a programme called `Ma6TvaCODER` where github had a central place between schools. Soon, it's been 60 students that were working together on this support, experimenting through content creation.

#### b. My personnal assignement for Git

I needed to go further with git to enhance my worflow, specialy for the fabacademy to responde to my personnal constraint. The biggest one is the time I loose in public transport, I have 1h30 to go from my place, Paris north, to the fablab Digiscope wich make 3 hours of public transport in a day... That's quite a lot of time and with the tool I owned, **I must be able to work on my phone**.
