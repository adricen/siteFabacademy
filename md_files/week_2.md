### I. Work through a git tutorial

#### 1. My history with git

I discovered git three years ago when I started to learn about web developpement.
At that time, I have been engaged in a quite big association in order to teech web developpement and coach young adulte living in popular area. I started to work on git hub with them, beginning by the online-interface of github, guid them through the creation of somme simple md files to learn about html structure. Then created a programme called [`Ma6TvaCODER`](https://github.com/Ma6Tvacoder-Docs) where github had a central place between schools. Soon, it's been 60 students that were working together on this support, experimenting through content creation.
