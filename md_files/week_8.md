Before beginning my design, I wanted to try diferent assembling part to try, and succed, to reproduce exactly what I designed initialy. We have a little cnc with a surface of 600mm by 350mm wich make difficulte to make some big pieces, but nothing is impossible :)

I started directly on VCarve using the vectorial software to design my first pieces.
