## Assignement - Make something Big !

### group assignment
  test runout, alignment, speeds, feeds, and toolpaths for your machine
### individual assignment
  make something big

### Let's start by warm it up !

The milling procedure include a warm up routin to prepar material before cutting anithing. It allow us to prevent any issue due to the machinery.

## Starting by testing

Before beginning my design, I wanted to try diferent assembling part to try, and succed, to reproduce exactly what I designed initialy. We have a little cnc with a surface of 600mm by 350mm wich make difficulte to make some big pieces, but nothing is impossible :)

I started directly on VCarve using the vectorial software to design my first pieces.

I managed to make it worked perfectly, so let's scale it up!

### Meeting whit machine boundaries.

We try to scale it up a little bit and struggle with the machin boundaries. It append that the actual limitation is 600mm x ~450mm and < 800mmx2 for the Z axis. So knowing this we choose a block with this size and a mill of 100mm and that's were problem start. The total Z distance is 1600mm and we were at that max with the fabric that was 800mm height and our mill that were also 800mm. In the end we finished with a Z zero at the maximum Z level and as the machin is made to move 0.5in upper from the top of the fabric, our material experiencing difficultie to move and just stay blocked.

## Make something BIG !

Making a full human size object could be a long creative process. So I choose to use a tool that I know well, Maya, at least for the design and creative process. I will reproduss the same object back in fusion once I'll be sure of my shape and design. Let's breakdown the process a little bit.
