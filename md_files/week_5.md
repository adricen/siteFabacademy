# Fabacademy : *Week 5* - - **February 07/2018**



## Assignement - electronics production

* ** group assignment: **
  - > characterize the specifications of your PCB production process
* ** individual assignment: **
  - > make an in-circuit programmer by milling the PCB,
  - > then optionally trying other processes

## 1. ** group assignment: ** -- Caracterize the specification of your PCB production process

### a. Fablab 503

Entering the fablab 503 was great, seing another space and another configuration.
It was highly equiped for electronics.

Here the process of making PCB is more by laser cutting than milling machin. **We choose, in accord with our local instructor, to make the milling mire on another assignement**.

#### <u>Making the Mire</u>

> Parametres :
* **Cut** : puissance - 40% / speed - 0.5% / 20khz
* **Engrave** : puissance - 100% / speed - 20% / 20khz

**The Process**
