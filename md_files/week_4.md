# Fabacademy : *Week 4* - **February 07/2018**



## Assignement - computer-controlled cutting

> * I. Group assignment:
      characterize your lasercutter
      making test part(s) that vary cutting settings and dimensions
   II. Individual assignment:
      cut something on the vinylcutter
      design, make, and document a parametric press-fit construction kit,
         accounting for the lasercutter kerf,
         which can be assembled in multiple ways

## II. Design, make and document a parametric press-fit construction kit

### <u>1. Defining a parametric shape</u>

Starting by that question, what could look like a parametric shape, fabric or building. Fastest way I know *ask google*.

I foun some really interesting result simply searchning for `parametric design`. I was particulary interested by  **hexagone shapes** that I found really well balanced. Here are some interesting features I found.

I had interessting point of view from my local instructor that pushes me always further. The last queston I had was, *how do you make it in 3D ?* and I finaly found the answer.

### <u>2. Fusion 360</u>

#### a. First Try

> <u>**Methods :**</u> Using reverse ingenering on the first `image`, I quickly made this design. To make it parametric and being able to bind elements with eachother, I am gona need of further tools.
* **Sketch dimension** => tap `D` or `sketch`>`sketch dimension`
* **Change parametres** => `Modify`>`change parametres`

With this simple two tools it's should be possible to construct a parametric design material.

I tryed to understand the concept of binding element together and how I could used it to my adventage.

#### b. A second test

> After few try on it, it came clear that I won't go far with my first sketch. I worked on a econd one, thinking symetry.

| Seing things from symetry point of view. ![starting](assets\img\Week4\fusion360_02.jpg) | The model work fine but something is wrong... ![starting](assets\img\Week4\fusion360_03.jpg) |
|--- | --- |

**I cant't editing it anymore** cause I had set the pivot point on the wrong side. Scaling it won't go well.

#### c. A last try

##### I finally made it through! I have a parametric design fabrics that adapte its shape to the weight of my material.

### <u>3. Then cutting some object and see how they work</u>
