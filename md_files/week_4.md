# Fabacademy : *Week 4* - **February 07/2018**



## Assignement - computer-controlled cutting

> * I. Group assignment:
      characterize your lasercutter
      making test part(s) that vary cutting settings and dimensions
   II. Individual assignment:
      cut something on the vinylcutter
      design, make, and document a parametric press-fit construction kit,
         accounting for the lasercutter kerf,
         which can be assembled in multiple ways

## II. Design, make and document a parametric press-fit construction kit

### <u>1. Fusion 360</u>

#### a. First Try

##### Starting By a simple shape.

##### Then Trying to bind some edges together

> I tryed to understand the concept of binding element together and how I could used it to my adventage.

#### b. A second test

##### Seing things from symetry point of view.

##### The model work fine but something is wrong...

I cant't eiting it enymore from that dymenssion cause I had set the pivot point on the wrong side. so the scaling effect doesn't go well.

#### c. A last try

##### I finally made it through! I have a parametric design fabrics that adapte its shape to the weight of my material.
