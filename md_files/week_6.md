# Fabacademy : *Week 6* **February 21/2018**
## Assignement - 3D scanning and printing

* ** group assignment: **
  - > test the design rules for your 3D printer(s)
* ** individual assignment: **
  - > design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that could not be made subtractively
  - > 3D scan an object (and optionally print it)

## Printing an electronic device

Let's try something new, We have a [conductive PLA from proto pasta](https://www.proto-pasta.com/pages/conductive-pla), so I want to give a shot and try to make something electronic printed. From the docmentation of the plastic, we can see that it have a resistivity of 30 ohm-cm on the X-Y axis and 150 ohm-cm on the Z axis.

So let's make some calcul, -- complete --

With this we can conclude that we have to make 5 spire to have a resistivity equivalente for our LED.
Let's jump to the realisation an see the result :

> This was a proof of concept and it worked! I probably investigate further to do a real functionnal printed device.

We have done another try with an ABS conductive material, but for now we are experiencing sticky probleme with this material... nothing fit for now.

## Making a parametric design in Antimony
(still need to print it)

## mixing organic and parametric shapes

In order to try to melt both technics, I tryed to mix to to differents type of shapes all made inside Zbrush.

## Scanning --

We just made the scanning assignement, so the documentation is in wip. We are gonna investigate further on scanning tool and have some cool information.

### Scanning process, made with a Minolta 3D scanner

The model had a lot of holes into his structure due to the imperfection of the scanning and the post process that was made quick du to a lack of time in the space.

## Knowing more about face normal and vertex normal

A normal is a vector that come frome a vertex or a face. It give the side of a face / edge / vertex. Manipulate normal allow you to change the perception of a face depending of his topology.

## Group assignement

Seing through our 3D printer at Digiscope Fablab, we have 2 kinds of 3d printer, Formalab and Ultimaker.

For the group Assignement, we are gonna test the Formalab 2 and the Ultimaker 3 Extended that we want to use for futur test of multiple material printing.

### Printing the sight on the formlab

My mistake was I did settup the support way to thin, so the model did fall in the back and fix itself on the bottom of the back. We will do it again.

Inbetween, we made a test print from a bust from Julie Taris wich make the Fabricademy here in the Digicscope that I help to make.

### Printing the sight on the Ultimaker 3

We send the print for the weekend

### Printing a sight for rotation parts

It did turn until 0.4 mm of diametre.
