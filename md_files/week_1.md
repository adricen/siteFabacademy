## Assignement - principles and practices

        plan and sketch a potential final project 

## Walkthrough

### And then it starte - conception

Before making this formation, I though a lot about what I wanted to do. Romain told me that I would have a final project to think of and to make through the end. At first I though that some robots legs or something like that would be perfect, but started before fabacademy made me see what kind of difficulties I would face in the futur and what I should focus on for now. The big thing wich is new for me here is electronics, but it seams to be a major skill for after, and I certainly want to master this in the futur... 

So changing my perspective, I started to think about a project involving more 1bout electronics and developpement and came with a 'Nird watch with a finger mouse on it`. I want to be able to control a computer, a phone or whatever needed a mouse only with my finger.

This would involve an accelerometre, the initial Nird watch that I have to modify a d enhance, and probably one or two other things. Include a fabIsp inside would be awesome, this way I wouod have a really cool tool, symbole of my emancipation of the virtual world, I like it. 'electronics', 'design' and 'Iot', sounds good.

## Practice

### parametric design

As I am a little early, Romain offer me to take adventage of my position and starting to work on futur assignement in order to help me conceptualized things further earlier.

So I started to work on Parametric design, a concept I know for a word I don't. The idear of parametr8c is something you can scale infinitly. On my websearch on the topic, I saw a lot of geometric design and found some prety cool shapes. I started to work on a first design, the classical said Romain. So I starting to think differently ane reverse ingeniering this picture ![](), I cam out with this :
A really simple shapse that allow a lot of differents designs, wich 8s r3ally cool. From when it took form, I couldn't stop looking for new configuration, the possibility it offert were promissing.

*pictures*

Romain push me further and ask me to think about a way to make it 3D, wich I think I found, But I need to make more of themes to be sure. It would make a pe4fect fit for a structural peace like a chaire or a smouth separation in a room. I think about it a lot.9
