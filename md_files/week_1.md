# Fabacademy : *Week 1* - **January 17/2018**

* **January 22 recitation: [version control (Fiore Basile)](http://fab.academany.org/2018/recitations/version-control.html#1)**

## Assignement - principles and practices - [schedule](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/principles_practices/index.html)

        plan and sketch a potential final project

## Project management
### Final Project V01 - 3D tracker bracelet.

**3D Mouse** - a wristband that track my hands and fingers and allow me to work within a 3D modeler, interact and sculpt objects with my right hand.

### Uses Cases :

* Using 3D mouse into a 3D world for object manipulation
* Working with "wilder" screen and being able to interact with huge virtual space.
* Moving his hand in virtual world for desable people with hand cut.
* Work inside 3D software like maya or blender


| | Description |
|---|---|
| **What will it do?** | Allow the control of an object or fonctionnality with the hand inside a 3D environment |
| **Who's done what beforehand?** | ![ nintendo gesture ](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wlEZSwAaKu-U2Get.jpg) |
| **What will you design?** | A bracelet with electronic designed board inside capable of detect hand and fingers gestures |
| **What materials and components will be used?** | 3D printers -- bracelet elements and electronic box </br> Laser cutter for pcb engraving</br> ATtiny44 for commmunication protocole and circuit management</br> Accelerometre for movement and direction detection |
| **How much will they cost?** | 50â‚¬ for the electronics and use of machines |
| **What parts and systems will be made?** | The device and the interface with computer |
| **What processes will be used?** | Bluetooth connection |
| **What questions need to be answered?** | How does bluetooth work?</br> How to translate accelerometre signale to something useable?</br> How to Embed electronic with 3D printed device?</br> How to programme with Python? |
|**How to use it?**| It must allow you to manipulate a 3D object through gesture in a 3D environement |
| **What's it look?** | ![sketch](assets\img\week1\handsDraw.jpg) |

> Other Potential final projects

## <u>V2 - Beatmachine Doorbell</u>
 ### Beatmachine Doorbell - *now you can ring my bell*

* Touch pad with glowing button
  * Leave a message
  * Change music features ( hiphop / techno / Jeanmichel Jar )
* Home box - shape of sound buffer with style
  * Music buffer
  * Micro to communicate
  * Listen messages
  * Save messages
  * See that you hav a message

### Pitch

Having a bell where your visitor can compose there own music. If you are not, here, then your friend, that have done all the road to come and see you, can compose a music and let it like a message for you. LEave yur friend a music!

#### Futur developpement

A lot of community are found of beat music and a device like that could esealy be scalable through all those home and connected to a global network where you can share your composition like snapchat or keakr. What not integrate it to an application like Keakr and offer the possbility to compose music at the bottom of an hlm and share it with your neighbourg.

### Design thinking

![inside3D](assets\img\finalProject\beatboxMachin.jpg)

The design is divided in three part, one input, the beatmachin, doorbell, one output, a bluetooth speaker and an interface to deal with content while connecting with mobil.
I choose to break it down a little bit for the final project. Two device, one input, one output and an online interface.

It can be break down from the minimum, the beatachin, to the full project, a beatmachin, with a bluetoth speaker where you can deal with your content on your mobile phone or a web interface. -->

After a lot of different iteration, and looking at the time left, I watch back my course and found out that I had already begin to work on differents side project. My favorite one was a little electronic game I started to do with a simple ATtiny45, buttons and LEDs. After reflexion and regarding what I come through, I though about a minimum game console I could make to ba able to understand all the process of making an electronic device.

V3 -


<!-- ### And then it starte - conception

Before making this formation, I though a lot about what I wanted to do. Romain told me that I would have a final project to think of and to make through the end. At first I though that some robots legs or something like that would be perfect, but started before fabacademy made me see what kind of difficulties I would face in the futur and what I should focus on for now. The big thing wich is new for me here is electronics, but it seams to be a major skill for after, and I certainly want to master this in the futur...

So changing my perspective, I started to think about a project involving more 1bout electronics and developpement and came with a 'Nird watch with a finger mouse on it`. I want to be able to control a computer, a phone or whatever needed a mouse only with my finger.

This would involve an accelerometre, the initial Nird watch that I have to modify a d enhance, and probably one or two other things. Include a fabIsp inside would be awesome, this way I wouod have a really cool tool, symbole of my emancipation of the virtual world, I like it. 'electronics', 'design' and 'Iot', sounds good.

## Practice

### parametric design

As I am a little early, Romain offer me to take adventage of my position and starting to work on futur assignement in order to help me conceptualized things further earlier.

So I started to work on Parametric design, a concept I know for a word I don't. The idear of parametr8c is something you can scale infinitly. On my websearch on the topic, I saw a lot of geometric design and found some prety cool shapes. I started to work on a first design, the classical said Romain. So I starting to think differently ane reverse ingeniering this picture ![](), I cam out with this :
A really simple shapse that allow a lot of differents designs, wich 8s r3ally cool. From when it took form, I couldn't stop looking for new configuration, the possibility it offert were promissing.

*pictures*

Romain push me further and ask me to think about a way to make it 3D, wich I think I found, But I need to make more of themes to be sure. It would make a pe4fect fit for a structural peace like a chaire or a smouth separation in a room. I think about it a lot.9 -->
