# Fabacademy : *Week 1* - **January 17/2018**

* **January 22 recitation: [version control (Fiore Basile)](http://fab.academany.org/2018/recitations/version-control.html#1)**

## Assignement - principles and practices

        plan and sketch a potential final project

## Project management
### Final Project V01 - 3D tracker bracelet.

| | Description |
|---|---|
| **What will it do?** | Allow the control of an object or fonctionnality with the hand inside a 3D environment |
| **Who's done what beforehand?** | ![ nintendo gesture ](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wlEZSwAaKu-U2Get.jpg) |
| **What will you design?** | A bracelet with electronic designed board inside capable of detect hand and fingers gestures |
| **What materials and components will be used?** | 3D printers -- bracelet elements and electronic box </br> Laser cutter for pcb engraving</br> ATtiny44 for commmunication protocole and circuit management</br> Accelerometre for movement and direction detection |
| **How much will they cost?** | 50â‚¬ for the electronics and use of machines |
| **What parts and systems will be made?** | The device and the interface with computer |
| **What processes will be used?** | Bluetooth connection |
| **What questions need to be answered?** | How does bluetooth work?</br> How to translate accelerometre signale to something useable?</br> How to Embed electronic with 3D printed device?</br> How to programme with Python? |
|**How to use it?**| It must allow you to manipulate a 3D object through gesture in a 3D environement |
| **What's it look?** | ![sketch](assets\img\week1\handsDraw.jpg) |

<!-- ### And then it starte - conception

Before making this formation, I though a lot about what I wanted to do. Romain told me that I would have a final project to think of and to make through the end. At first I though that some robots legs or something like that would be perfect, but started before fabacademy made me see what kind of difficulties I would face in the futur and what I should focus on for now. The big thing wich is new for me here is electronics, but it seams to be a major skill for after, and I certainly want to master this in the futur...

So changing my perspective, I started to think about a project involving more 1bout electronics and developpement and came with a 'Nird watch with a finger mouse on it`. I want to be able to control a computer, a phone or whatever needed a mouse only with my finger.

This would involve an accelerometre, the initial Nird watch that I have to modify a d enhance, and probably one or two other things. Include a fabIsp inside would be awesome, this way I wouod have a really cool tool, symbole of my emancipation of the virtual world, I like it. 'electronics', 'design' and 'Iot', sounds good.

## Practice

### parametric design

As I am a little early, Romain offer me to take adventage of my position and starting to work on futur assignement in order to help me conceptualized things further earlier.

So I started to work on Parametric design, a concept I know for a word I don't. The idear of parametr8c is something you can scale infinitly. On my websearch on the topic, I saw a lot of geometric design and found some prety cool shapes. I started to work on a first design, the classical said Romain. So I starting to think differently ane reverse ingeniering this picture ![](), I cam out with this :
A really simple shapse that allow a lot of differents designs, wich 8s r3ally cool. From when it took form, I couldn't stop looking for new configuration, the possibility it offert were promissing.

*pictures*

Romain push me further and ask me to think about a way to make it 3D, wich I think I found, But I need to make more of themes to be sure. It would make a pe4fect fit for a structural peace like a chaire or a smouth separation in a room. I think about it a lot.9 -->
