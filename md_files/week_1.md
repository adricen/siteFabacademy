        plan and sketch a potential final project 

## Walkthrough

### And then it starte

Before making this formation, I though a lot about what I wanted to do. Romain told me that I would have a final project to think of and to make through the end. At first I though that some robots legs or something like that would be perfect, but started before fabacademy made me see what kind of difficulties I would face in the futur and what I should focus on for now. The big thing wich is new for me here is electronics, but it seams to be a major skill for after, and I certainly want to master this in the futur... 

So changing my perspective, I started to think about a project involving more 1bout electronics and developpement and came with a 'Nird watch with a finger mouse on it`. I want to be able to control a computer, a phone or whatever needed a mouse only with my finger.

This would involve an accelerometre, the initial Nird watch that I have to modify a d enhance, and probably one or two other things. Include a fabIsp inside would be awesome, this way I wouod have a really cool tool, symbole of my emancipation of the virtual world, I like it. 'electronics', 'design' and 'Iot', sounds good.
