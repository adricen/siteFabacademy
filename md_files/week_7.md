### Redesign the HelloBoard

I started lately working on KiCAD trying to re-design the HelloBoard. As a beginner on this software, I found a documentation that someone made in the past [here](http://archive.fabacademy.org/2017/fablabnervecentre/students/401/assignment6.html). So I reproducte the schematiks.
