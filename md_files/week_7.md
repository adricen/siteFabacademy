# Fabacademy : *Week 7* - **February 28/2018**


## Assignment - Electronics Design

### group project:
   use the test equipment in your lab to observe the operation
      of a microcontroller circuit board

### individual project:
   redraw the echo hello-world board,
   add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor)
   check the design rules, make it, and test it
   extra credit: simulate its operation
   extra credit: render it

## Production


### Lexique

ohm law : U = R * I

* Voltage / Tention :
  Resistance multiply by Intensity. It's unite is Voltage => V

* Resistance :
  Limitation of the current. it's unite is in ohm.

* Impedence :
  Equivalent to resistance for alternative current

* Capacitence :
  Stabilize current

* Intensit√© / Current :


### Redesign the HelloBoard

I started lately working on KiCAD trying to re-design the HelloBoard. As a beginner on this software, I found a documentation that someone made in the past [here](http://archive.fabacademy.org/2017/fablabnervecentre/students/401/assignment6.html). So I reproducte the schematiks.
