## Mechanical design

<!-- * Que fait la machine ?
* Quel taille
* Quel format ?
* Quel mouvement ?
* Resultats attendus ?
* Etat de l'art ?

Sur la vidéo aéromorphe, la machine parait un peu overkill, oui ?

Veut-on chauffer autre choses.

Fer à souder => Création d'un fer à main, est-il possible d'utiliser plusieurs piles à inductions?

Taille de la bille ?

axe X + y + faux Z

Fer à souder avec embout adapté pour le heatsealing

En parrallèle, reflexion pour remplacer completement le fer.

1er semaine, actu à la main

Back in october 2017, the first session of Fabricademy started and the fablab digiscope was one of it's node. One of it's student, [Julie Taris](http://wiki.textile-academy.org/fabricademy2017/students/julie.taris/start) , started to work on a new and inovative subject, **soft robotic**. Through her experimentation, I saw an all new technologie rising from silicon and heat sealed vinyl.

Looking for solution to complete her project she found some really creative process of soft Robots made by a team of the MIT through the project [Aeromorph](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/aeromorph/). A machin is used to heat and seal material around a precise design wich, once inflated, will take another shape and could even be animated blowing some air or liquid passing through pockets. In their process, they blue some air.

### Design thinking

Starting machin design is a good oportunity to mobilized and concretise all the knowledge learn making the fabacademy. Through design thinking I'll try to answer serveral question about my futur machin, what's the purpose and how to do it. Let's break it down and answering some few questions :

#### What does the machin do ?

This machin leads a soldering iron mechanicaly under vinyl to creat some pattern to drive air through a path a be able to mold it's shape.

#### What size does it have ?

We would like to be able to work on some big area. In the fablab digicscope we have some big facom table wich would be perfect as a support for this futur machin. But thinking adaptability, we are gona think about this kind of support but about something that could be adaptable for any table or surfaces.


#### what kind of movements ?

We are speaking about a soldering iron that goes under some vinyl material, so it must be able to move X and Y and be pressed, or not, on the fabric. So it's X, Y and a false Z.

#### What kind of result ?

It must provide some fabric sealed, werable or not, strong enough to support strong air inside. The patern must come from a numeric format and

#### Etat de l'art ?

Further technics and exploration are on the run, so I'll focus on machins and things that I could use as reference to reverse ingenering and design this futur machin.

Here is a list of interesting project that I will use as inspiration and reference.

### Testing for thinking

I start to mill a simple rack and pinion to better visualize what it should look like and how it will work together.

Then starting to design. My first objective was to adapte the machinery to the size of the Facom table we have here at **Fabaab Digiscope**.
So I tryed to adapte a rack ad pinion design from .. and made a quick sketch => ![machin design](assets\img\week15\design01.png)

I wasn't satisfied by the working surface and the quantity of material I would need to do it. I changed and start to work with another model, I choose to work from the basis of Jacob
