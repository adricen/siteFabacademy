# Final Project Developpement - 3D mouse wristband

<!-- ## Concept :

**3D Mouse** - a wristband that track my hands and fingers and allow me to work within a 3D modeler, interact and sculpt objects with my right hand.

### Uses Cases :

* Using 3D mouse into a 3D world for object manipulation
* Working with "wilder" screen and being able to interact with huge virtual space.
* Moving his hand in virtual world for desable people with hand cut.
* Work inside 3D software -->

## Project thinking

<!-- Version 2 -->
<!-- ### <u>Beatmachine Doorbell - *now you can ring my bell*</u>

* Touch pad with glowing button
  * Leave a message
  * Change music features ( hiphop / techno / Jeanmichel Jar )
* Home box - shape of sound buffer with style
  * Music buffer
  * Micro to communicate
  * Listen messages
  * Save messages
  * See that you hav a message

### Pitch

Having a bell where your visitor can compose there own music. If you are not, here, then your friend, that have done all the road to come and see you, can compose a music and let it like a message for you. LEave yur friend a music!

#### Futur developpement

A lot of community are found of beat music and a device like that could esealy be scalable through all those home and connected to a global network where you can share your composition like snapchat or keakr. What not integrate it to an application like Keakr and offer the possbility to compose music at the bottom of an hlm and share it with your neighbourg.

### Design thinking

The design is divided in three part, one input, the beatmachin, doorbell, one output, a bluetooth speaker and an interface to deal with content while connecting with mobil.
I choose to break it down a little bit for the final project. Two device, one input, one output and an online interface.

It can be break down from the minimum, the beatachin, to the full project, a beatmachin, with a bluetoth speaker where you can deal with your content on your mobile phone or a web interface. -->

After a lot of different iteration, and looking at the time left, I watch back my course and found out that I had already begin to work on differents side project. My favorite one was a little electronic game I started to do with a simple ATtiny45, buttons and LEDs. After reflexion and regarding what I come through, I though about a minimum game console I could make to ba able to understand all the process of making an electronic device.

## Design

The goal is to have a base, with two or three controler pluged-in and a connexion to a computer. In the end it shoud be able to communicate with a web application and a simple game. The game controler shoudl have left / right direction and one button.

### the Base

The base is the master of all the system. It allow the user to plug his controler and play to the game he selected. In the end the controler could as the user want it to be. I want to be able to experiment with controlers.

I designed a simple base for now, exploiting the japonize join I learned on the machin design assignements.
