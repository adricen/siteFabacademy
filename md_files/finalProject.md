# Final Project Developpement

## Game controler with connecting base

### Concept

This project have the goal to extend game controlers for computer to be able to try and design differents input and output through game design. It's design to become a console extension for computers. A plug and play device

#### <a name="what"></a>What will it do ?

The Game controler is a little dock station where you can plug-in differents controlers. The main idea is to be able to plug-in some simple and more complex controlers to play with games like unity or web.

#### <a name="who"></a>Who's done what beforehand ?

*Thomas Laubach* - [LEDmePLAY](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabkamplintfort/students/125/project_result.html) - video game system

#### <a name="design"></a>What will you design ?

##### main Base
* cardboard
* 3D package

##### Game controler
* cardboard
* 3D package

#### <a name="component"></a>What materials and components will be used ?

* ATMega32 --> on the mother box
* ATtiny45 on game controler
* I2C as communication protocole
* Processing interface or web interface HTML / CSS / Javascript

#### <a name="come"></a>Where will it come from ?

This project come from a desire to explore electronic through a well known subject. The embed electronic are designed to be the simple as possible to fully understand what's up under the hood and to play with it in designing new and other game controler. It must be fully interfaced with internet so that it could interacte with web content.

#### <a name="cost"></a> How much will they cost ?

I still need to investigate on the price it could cost at the end but so far, but it would be something around 10€ in printing and less than 10€ in electronics. Everything else is coding and web content so it don't have any direct costs.

#### <a name="made"></a>What parts and systems will be made?

I have to do everything, from product packaging to web developpement passing by electronics. But when I though about this project I wanted it simple enough to be able to work on each part and succed to a good degree of comprehension of what I did.

#### <a name="process"></a>What processes will be used ?

* 3D printer --> Packaging
* Laser cutter --> PCB engraving
* ATMega32 --> on the mother box
* ATtiny45 on game controler
* I2C as communication protocole
* Web interface HTML / CSS / Javascript

#### <a name="question"></a>What questions need to be answered ?

* How can I make it scalable, having unlimited amount of controler
* How do I make My game controler communicate with a website ? --> protocole souris / web
* Will communication process will be quick enought to be playable ?

#### <a name="evaluated"></a>How will it be evaluated?

* The fina product must be fully fonctionnal
* Capable of interact with web content
* Being open source and fully reproductible

> I have a esign problem, my clips are too fit probably, I should have another try to make them better. Maybe by changing the printed orientation.

> Other Potential final projects
## <u>V1 - 3D mouse wristband</u>
### Concept :

**3D Mouse** - a wristband that track my hands and fingers and allow me to work within a 3D modeler, interact and sculpt objects with my right hand.

### Uses Cases :

* Using 3D mouse into a 3D world for object manipulation
* Working with "wilder" screen and being able to interact with huge virtual space.
* Moving his hand in virtual world for desable people with hand cut.
* Work inside 3D software like maya or blender

## <u>V2 - Beatmachine Doorbell</u>
 ### Beatmachine Doorbell - *now you can ring my bell*

* Touch pad with glowing button
  * Leave a message
  * Change music features ( hiphop / techno / Jeanmichel Jar )
* Home box - shape of sound buffer with style
  * Music buffer
  * Micro to communicate
  * Listen messages
  * Save messages
  * See that you hav a message

### Pitch

Having a bell where your visitor can compose there own music. If you are not, here, then your friend, that have done all the road to come and see you, can compose a music and let it like a message for you. LEave yur friend a music!

#### Futur developpement

A lot of community are found of beat music and a device like that could esealy be scalable through all those home and connected to a global network where you can share your composition like snapchat or keakr. What not integrate it to an application like Keakr and offer the possbility to compose music at the bottom of an hlm and share it with your neighbourg.

### Design thinking

![inside3D](assets\img\finalProject\beatboxMachin.jpg)

The design is divided in three part, one input, the beatmachin, doorbell, one output, a bluetooth speaker and an interface to deal with content while connecting with mobil.
I choose to break it down a little bit for the final project. Two device, one input, one output and an online interface.

It can be break down from the minimum, the beatachin, to the full project, a beatmachin, with a bluetoth speaker where you can deal with your content on your mobile phone or a web interface. -->

After a lot of different iteration, and looking at the time left, I watch back my course and found out that I had already begin to work on differents side project. My favorite one was a little electronic game I started to do with a simple ATtiny45, buttons and LEDs. After reflexion and regarding what I come through, I though about a minimum game console I could make to ba able to understand all the process of making an electronic device.

## Design

The goal is to have a base, with two or three controler pluged-in and a connexion to a computer. In the end it shoud be able to communicate with a web application and a simple game. The game controler shoudl have left / right direction and one button.

### the Base

The base is the master of all the system. It allow the user to plug his controler and play to the game he selected. In the end the controler could as the user want it to be. I want to be able to experiment with controlers.

I designed a simple base for now, exploiting the japonize join I learned on the machin design assignements.
