## Project thinking

### Design thinking

The design is divided in three part, one input, the beatmachin, doorbell, one output, a bluetooth speaker and an interface to deal with content while connecting with mobil.
I choose to break it down a little bit for the final project. Two device, one input, one output and an online interface.

It can be break down from the minimum, the beatachin, to the full project, a beatmachin, with a bluetoth speaker where you can deal with your content on your mobile phone or a web interface.
